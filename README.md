This repository includes data and script relative to the "Spatial Mark-Resight Models With Acoustic Data" paper by Alberto De Rosa, Isabel Castro, and Stephen Marsland.

I will include a more detailed description of the scripts and better commented code therein as soon as possible.

Until then, feel free to contact me at derosa1@ualberta.ca for any question or comment related to the code.

Cheers,
alberto
